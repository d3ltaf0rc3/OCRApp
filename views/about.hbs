            <h1>What is OCR?</h1>
            <p>Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical
                conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a
                scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in
                a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television
                broadcast).</p>
